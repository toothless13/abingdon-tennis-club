                        Our preferred method of payment is by Direct Debit, working in conjunction with GoCardless. To pay on-line with GoCardless you will need to specify your bank sort code and account number and your payment is processed as a direct debit. This is a one-off payment for this membership year. ALTC will not automatically debit your account in subsequent years, so you always have full control over your renewal. Please note that Cheques or Cash are not accepted as a form of payment. If you cannot use GoCardless, then a bank transfer is acceptable â€“ be sure to include your full name as the reference.
